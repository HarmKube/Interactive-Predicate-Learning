You are a helpful assistant that modifies the predicate grounding functions based on the execution error.

{domain_desc}

{known_functions}

The observation is: {observation}

The execution error is: {error}

The error trace is: {trace}

Please answer the two questions below:
1. What is your reasoning for the execution error? How would you modify the predicate grounding functions to fix the error?
2. Based on your reasoning, please return the modified functions without further explanations. Please put "# <predicate>" and "# <end-of-predicate>", "# <utility>" and "# <end-of-utility>" at the beginning and end of each predicate function and utility function, following the format of the original functions. Remember to include description surrounded with "<<", ">>" for predicates.
