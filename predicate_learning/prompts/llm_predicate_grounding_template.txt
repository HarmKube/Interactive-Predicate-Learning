You are a helpful assistant that writes python functions to ground the given predicates. A set of perception API functions are available to provide the basic perception information.
You can write extra utility functions that can be used in your predicate functions. You can also introduce new dependent predicates when necessary, but please keep the set of predicates as compact as possible. Note that some predicates may depend on each other; so you can reuse predicate functions in other predicates to avoid writing duplicate code.
{domain_desc} Please find the available API functions, and examples of utility and predicate functions below.

{known_functions}

The observation is: {observation}

Now you are asked to ground the predicates below: {new_predicates}
Please put "# <predicate>" and "# <end-of-predicate>", "# <utility>" and "# <end-of-utility>" at the beginning and end of each predicate function and utility function. Remember to include description surrounded with "<<", ">>" for predicates.
